## ✨ What is My Learning Tracker?

**My Learning Tracker** is not a to-do app.  
It is a **Learning Operating System** designed to apply *engineering discipline* to self-directed technical growth.

**Instead of asking *“Did you study today?”**, it asks:

- Are you **shipping learning outcomes** on schedule?
- Is your **learning velocity improving or decaying**?
- Are missed deadlines **corrected automatically**?
- Can your readiness be **audited with evidence**?
---
The result:  
> **Learning treated like a production system - measurable, accountable, and continuously optimized.**

## 🧩 Problem It Solves

Self-learning often fails because it lacks:

- Enforcement mechanisms  
- Feedback loops  
- Velocity tracking  
- External accountability  

LearningOps fixes this by modeling learning like **product operations**, complete with rules, metrics, and remediation.

---

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

| Traditional Learning | LearningOps |
|----------------------|-------------|
| Motivation-driven | System-driven |
| Passive tracking | Enforced accountability |
| Completion-based | Velocity-based |
| Notes & checklists | Metrics & artifacts |

---

## 🔥 Key Capabilities

### ⚙️ 1. Accountability Engine (Rules-Driven)

LearningOps enforces discipline automatically.

- **Missed deadline?**  
  → A *Compensation Task* is auto-generated and due the next day.
- **Zero manual policing**  
  → Rules execute on every state change.
- **Inspired by production incident remediation workflows**

> Your system *never forgets*.

---

### 📈 2. Learning Velocity Intelligence

- Real-time velocity vs workload tracking
- Deterministic scoring engine (no APIs, no AI black boxes)
- Intensity ratings:
  - 🟢 Low  
  - 🟡 Moderate  
  - 🔥 Elite  

Velocity is **earned**, not guessed.

---

### 📊 3. Analytics-First Dashboard

Designed like a product metrics console:

- ⏱ Hours logged
- 🔥 Consistency streaks
- 📈 Velocity trends
- 🧠 Subjective mastery scoring
- 📉 Burn-up & radar charts

Powered by **Recharts**, optimized for clarity — not noise.

---

### 🧪 4. Capstone Readiness Index

Learning without proof is noise.

This module tracks **verifiable artifacts** across five competency pillars:

1. Data Sourcing  
2. Data Cleaning  
3. Analysis  
4. Visualization  
5. Communication  

Each skill must be backed by **real evidence**:
- GitHub repositories  
- Deployed dashboards  
- Written analyses  

> Readiness becomes **auditable**, not aspirational.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|------|------------|
| Frontend | React 18 (Hooks, Context, Custom Hooks) |
| Language | TypeScript |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS |
| Charts | Recharts |
| State Persistence | LocalStorage (`useLocalStorage`) |
| Architecture | Zero-backend, browser-native |

---

## 🧩 Architecture Highlights

- **Rules Engine** embedded directly in application state flow
- **Multi-domain state orchestration** (Logs, Syllabus, Scores, Profiles)
- **Zero external dependencies** for analytics logic
- **Audit-ready structure** with clean separation of concerns

This is **systems engineering**, not CRUD.

---
